        <h2>이런 것을 잘해요?</h2>
        <p>Remember when we held on in the rain The night we almost lost it
          Once again we can take the night into tomorrow Living on feelings
          Touching you I feel it all again Didn't we almost have it all When
          love was all we had worth giving? The ride with you was worth the
          fall my friend Loving you makes life worth living Didn't we almost
          have it all The night we held on till the morning You know you'll
          never love that way again Didn't we almost have it all</p>

        <h2>나의 최근 프로젝트 설명</h2>
        <p>There comes a time When we heed a certain call When the world must
          come together as one There are people dying Oh, and it's time to lend
          a hand to life The greatest gift of all We can't go on Pretending day-by-day
          That someone, somewhere soon make a change We're all a part of God's great
          big family And the truth, you know, love is all we need We are the world We
          are the children We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let's start
          giving There's a choice we're making We're saving our own lives It's true
          we'll make a better day, just you and me Oh, send them your heart So they
          know that someone cares And their lives will be stronger and free As God
          has shown us by turning stones to bread And so we all must lend a helping
          hand We are the world We are the children We are the ones who make a brighter
          day, so let's start giving Oh, there's a choice we're making We're saving our
          own lives It's true we'll make a better day, just you and me</p>
